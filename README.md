### I have added filter to "shop component " after click on "see all categories" becuase of lack of time. Filter can work with title & category of product. Finally I saved filtered values & filterobj inside productsclice

### I couldn't find api of product with pageinagtion so inside "home component" I create that. But it is better that we create a api & select special query for that page and this will increase performance.

#### we can use react-window for large list ,but my time was limit . but I used reselect inside redux toolkit for memorizing those values that we had taked before .also usememo or memo

### I used logger inside store to log actions

#### actionrequest for globaly use same get function of http request ,Althogh I think graphQl is much better option for ecommerce apps
